# Run algorithm for range of N, & plot best_fitness vs N (set vmax_coeff=0.1)
N = [10, 20, 30, 50]
```


## How does the number of particles affect the result of the PSO algorithm?

```
# Run algorithm for range of vmax_coeff, the cutoff velocity coefficient (choose N according to experiment above)
vmax_coeff = [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3]

```

## How does the velocity cut-off ùë£ùëöùëéùë• affect the result of the PSO algorithm?

```
# Run algorithm 10 times, noting the prediction accuracy (or error) for each run 
# TODO

# Plot the best_fitness of each run vs. the number of iterations it took (in case of stop condition #2)
# TODO

# For one of the 10 runs (choose the one with the best fitness), plot J(w1, w2) as a function of the iteration number
# TODO
