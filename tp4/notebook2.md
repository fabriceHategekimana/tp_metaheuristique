# Part 2

as(city1)
as(city2)

```python
from module import ant_path

ant_path("src/data/cities.dat")
```

change m and t_max

Compare with:
nearest_neighbour_algorithm

Plot 

Generate 50, 60, 80, 100
mean_standard_deviation([time, length])

## Comments

1. The effect of varying t_max and m (number of ants)
2. Greedy vs Ant System
3. Performance of the Ant System and the SA on the TSP about time and length 

In the comments, answer the following questions:
1. What is the Search Space for Ant System algorithm
2. Can you describe the neighborhood in this case
3. Takl about the impact of parameters alpha, beta and rho
